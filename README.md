# Moon Garden

Moon Garden is a development streamlining tool for the [Fennel][1] programming language.\
This tool is aimed to make the general purpose programming experience for Fennel smoother.\
With help from the Fennel compiler, Moon Garden can compile .fnl to .lua files in a given directory as well as watching for file changes.

## Installation

Moon Garden can be downloaded from LuaRocks

```shell
luarocks install moongarden
```

## Usage

```shell
Moon Garden v0.1.0

Usage: moongarden [[--path [FILE|DIRECTORY]] [--out [DIRECTORY]] [,--verbose]]

Outputs a structure of folders / files containing .fnl files and outputs the same structure as .lua files

FLAGS
  --path      : Relative path of the input files - Default ./src
  --out       : Relative path of the output files - Default ./out
  --verbose   : Shows the build output - Defalt false
  --watch     : Watches for files changes and copies from [path] to [out] - Default false
  -h, --help  : Show this help text
```

### About --watch

The `--watch` command relies on [entr][2] to watch when the .fnl files change as you save your work. Entr works on UNIX based systems and will need to be installed locally. Moon Garden will tell you if you don't have Entr installed if you try to use the `--watch` flag. You can use [WSL][3] (Windows Subsystem for Linux) when using Windows.
